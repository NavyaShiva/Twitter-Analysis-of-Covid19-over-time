## BACKGROUND
The COVID‑19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2).[1] The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.[4] The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March.

So far an exploratory study concerning what people are tweeting about and the sentiment over different topics related to Coronavirus has not been performed. This involved working on real-time data generated from the Twitter to understand general public opinion and sentiments towards the COVID-19 pandemic. 


## OBJECTIVE
This project focuses on finding the shift in the public opinion about the coronavirus disease over time based on the texts from the social media platform, Twitter. 
A machine learning model is built to classify the users into organization or individual as we wanted to study only the individual's opinion and remove the bias added by the organizations. Implemented rule-based model Vader to obtain the sentiments of the topics over the weeks.
